# DotBack Development Status

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure

## Completed Features
- Basic project structure
- Go module initialization
- CLI framework setup with cobra
- Version command implementation
- Basic documentation (README.md)
- Logging system implementation
- Core types and interfaces
- GitHub authentication implementation (using official GitHub Go client)
- Login command implementation with secure token storage
- Logout command implementation
- Configuration management implementation
- Unit tests for:
  - Logger package
  - GitHub client
  - Login/logout commands
  - Secure storage
  - Configuration manager

## In Progress
- Integration tests for GitHub operations
- End-to-end tests for CLI commands

## Next Steps
- Add integration tests for GitHub operations
- Add end-to-end tests for CLI commands
- Implement scan command for dotfiles and applications

## Future Phases
- Phase 2: Scanning Implementation
- Phase 3: Backup Implementation
- Phase 4: Restore Implementation
- Phase 5: Documentation and Polish

## Manual Testing Instructions
1. Build and run the CLI:
```bash
go run cmd/dotback/*.go
```

2. Check available commands:
```bash
go run cmd/dotback/*.go --help
```

3. Check version:
```bash
go run cmd/dotback/*.go version
```

4. Login with GitHub (requires a Personal Access Token):
```bash
# Either set the token in environment:
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
dotback login

# Or enter it interactively:
dotback login
```

5. Verify login and logout:
```bash
# Try logging in again (should fail)
dotback login

# Log out
dotback logout

# Log in again (should succeed)
dotback login
```

## Development Instructions
1. Run tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

2. Run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

## Dependencies
- github.com/spf13/cobra - CLI framework
- github.com/google/go-github/v60 - Official GitHub API client
- golang.org/x/oauth2 - OAuth2 support for GitHub authentication
- github.com/zalando/go-keyring - Secure token storage

## Next Implementation Tasks
1. Update login command to use secure storage
2. Add integration tests for GitHub operations
3. Add end-to-end tests for CLI commands
4. Add more test coverage for edge cases
