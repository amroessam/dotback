ðŸ¤– Let me first check if there are any other project files that might give us more context.

Ran tool


Let me check if there's a DEVELOPMENT.md file to understand the current state.

Ran tool


I understand the requirements from the INSTRUCTIONS.md file. This is a CLI tool called `dotback` that helps users backup and restore their dotfiles and application configurations using GitHub as storage. Let me break down the implementation plan:

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Structure
1. Set up the basic Go project structure
   - Create go.mod
   - Set up directory structure
   - Create main package
   - Set up CLI framework (using cobra)
   - Set up logging
   - Create DEVELOPMENT.md

2. Implement GitHub Authentication (`dotback login`)
   - GitHub API integration
   - PAT token storage (securely)
   - Authentication state management

3. Create Core Types and Interfaces
   - Machine configuration type
   - Backup configuration type
   - GitHub client interface
   - File system interface for better testability

#### Phase 2: Scanning Implementation
1. Implement File Scanner (`dotback scan`)
   - Create scanner package
   - Implement dotfile detection
   - Implement application detection
   - Add verbose mode support
   - Add tests

#### Phase 3: Backup Implementation
1. Implement Backup System (`dotback backup`)
   - Create backup package
   - Implement repository management
   - Implement machine management
   - Create backup wizard
   - Implement file copying and GitHub upload
   - Add tests

#### Phase 4: Restore Implementation
1. Implement Restore System (`dotback restore`)
   - Create restore package
   - Implement repository selection
   - Implement machine selection
   - Create restore wizard
   - Implement symlink creation
   - Add tests

#### Phase 5: Documentation and Polish
1. Complete Documentation
   - Update README.md
   - Add usage examples
   - Document configuration options
   - Add contribution guidelines

2. Final Testing and Polish
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end testing
   - Error handling improvements
   - CLI UX improvements

### Technical Decisions:
1. **Language**: Go 1.22+ (for latest features and stability)
2. **Dependencies** (minimal):
   - cobra: CLI framework
   - go-git: Git operations
   - keyring: Secure credential storage
   - testify: Testing (if needed)

3. **Project Structure**:
```
dotback/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dotback/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.go
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ scan/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ backup/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ restore/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ common/
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ github/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â”œâ”€â”€ go.sum
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ DEVELOPMENT.md
```

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Unit tests for each package
   - Integration tests for GitHub operations
   - Mock interfaces for filesystem and GitHub API
   - End-to-end tests for CLI commands

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Secure storage of GitHub PAT
   - Validation of all user inputs
   - Proper permission handling
   - Safe symlink creation

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation plan? We can start with Phase 1 if you agree, or I can adjust the plan based on your feedback.
